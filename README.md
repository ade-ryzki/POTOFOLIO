# Yo!Photo Project

Welcome! This is our final project for the `Glints Part Time Boot Camp` prokect, this website is still in **development**! Built with React, Redux and CSS.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start the application, follow this steps:

1. Get the backend server url from backend devs.
2. Create an empty .env file in the root folder
3. Put `APP_REACT_URL_API=https://backend.server.url.address`, change the url with the url you got from backend dev.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the program without building it. The app should've started at `http://localhost:3000`
5. For other start-up option, please check the start-up script in the `package.json` file.
